# Important Notice

The AltaicaOS project wasn't been initiated by me ([Daniella Mesquita](https://danimesq.com)), but by its original creators: [@nt1m](https://github.com/nt1m) and [@dakoder](https://github.com/dakoder). I just revived and continued their work on Altaica's web OS and its apps.

[@nt1m](https://github.com/nt1m) has authorized me to make public and continue the work in the [AltaicaStore](https://github.com/AltaicaTech/AltaicaStore) in a Google Hangouts chat.
